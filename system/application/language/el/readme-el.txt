Dear all,

Following our previous discussion please find attached the translated strings for Cloudworks.  Note that I included some comments on a couple of strings that were a bit confusing. On 1-2 cases I think there might be a syntax error on the initial string. Nick, regarding your last email you can find my responses below in red. 

After a brief brainstorming we decided not to translate key terms such as "Following" and "Followers", since the greek translation of the terms do not make much sense in the context of Social Networking and a couple of other options we thought of sound a bit weird.

We will be expecting the translation to be applied to Cloudworks in order to proceed with further revisions.


Best Wishes,
